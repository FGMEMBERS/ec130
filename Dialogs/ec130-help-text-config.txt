   Introduction:
   ==========
   The Configuration Dialog for the EC130-B4/H130 is a highly integrated dialog and 
   combines several standard FlightGear dialogs into one. Numerous interactions between
   the settings are implemented in order to allow a very consistent setup of different
   helicopter variants.

   It is possible to:

    - select a livery
    - choose the seating configuration
    - choose aircraft specific views
    - set fuel amount
    - set weights of passengers and luggage
    - choose exterior equipment

   When first opened, the settings reflect the values predefined for the current
   helicopter variant in the livery XML file.


   Consistency Rules:
   ===============
   There are several principles defined for the helicopter configuration, which
   are ensured by dependencies between different settings.

    - Each internal view corresponds to a specific seat and passenger.
    - A view can only be active if the corresponding seat-weight is set to some
      value > 30lbs (the weight of an empty seat), i.e. a passenger is present.
    - If a view is activated, or the corresponding passenger is seated by clicking
      a seat, the corresponding seat-weight is set to 30+150lbs,
      i.e. the default passenger is a person with 150lbs weight.
    - If a view is deactivated, or the passenger removed, the corresponding
      seat-weight is set to minimum.
    - If - on the other hand - a seat-related weight is set to minimum (30lbs)
      in the weight settings, then the corresponding view is deactivated and the
      passenger removed.
    - If co-pilot controls are not there a passenger is seated in the co-pilot
      seat.
    - Either pilot or co-pilot must be present. i.e. if the pilot is removed
      the co-pilot (and his controls) are activated if necessary.
    - If only the co-pilot is there, his controls cannot be removed.
    - Seats which are optional (i.e. not there in 5 pass. or Rescue (EMS) variant)
      have a min. weight of 0, all other seats have a min weight of 30 lbs.

    Remark: The stretcher in the EMS configuration (Emergency Medical Service)
    replaces 2 seats, but only one related view is assigned (Patient View).


   Interior:
   ======
   The cabin can be setup in three different variants which result in different
   numbers of available seats and internal views.

   Seats can be clicked to activate the passenger. Passengers can be clicked in
   order to be removed.

   Weights:
   =======
   There are three kinds of weights.

    - Seat related weights
    - Luggage related weights
    - Equipment (no slider)

   Seat related weights are closely tied to the corresponding view (see above).

   The Equipment weight is automatically derived and summed up from the chosen
   exterior equipment (see below).


   Equipment:
   =========
   There are two kinds of equipment:

    - combinable equipment
    - mutually exclusive equipment

   The mutually exclusive equipment cannot be used together for technical or
   mechanical reasons (e.g. floats cannot be used together with baskets).

   If exclusive equipment is selected, it deactivates any conflicting other equipment.


   Antenna Setup:
   =============
   The "Antenna Setup" dialog is used to configure the antennas of the aircraft.
   Some consistency rules apply as it is not possible to choose every combination
   of available antennas e.g. due to conflicting mounting positions. In case of conflict
   antennas are disabled.

   Have fun in setting up your desired helicopter variant, and have safe flights.


   Some Remarks on View-Handling:
   -----------------------------
   The idea of having a tight relation between seat-weights and views intends to
   provide a realistic setup. This however implies quite a number of different views,
   which add up to the various predefined views in FlightGear.

   With standard FlightGear setup (FG 3.4) and its limited view-control functionality,
   which only allows to scroll forward or backward between ALL active views, this may
   seem unrealistic and hard to handle .

   View handling gets much easier, if the view control is configured to allow more
   flexibility.

   In the installation environment, where the EC130 was developed and refined, the view 
   control is configured in a way, so that all predefined FG views are deactivated and 
   accessed directly through various Fx function keys. The built-in FG view-scroll 
   functionality is then used only for the EC130 specific views.

   Limitation: For now (FG 3.4) the improved view handling can only be done through
   changing the keyboard assignments on a deeper level (keyboard.xml) and not through
   some customization dialog. Hope is, that this will be improved in future FG versions.

   Alternative with Minimum Number of Active Views:
   -----------------------------------------------
   If you prefer to have a limited number of views active you may disable most/all views.
   In order to still have enough weight assigned to the helicopter you may increase the
   weight of active pilots/passengers (realistic weight distribution) or just increase
   the luggage weight, which is less realistic for weight distribution.
