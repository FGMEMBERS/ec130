   Personal Notes of the Livery Editor (mhab):
   ------------------------------------------
   The Broward County livery is beautiful and the painting is not very hard to do.
   More effort was needed to apply the Sheriffs' star symbol. The model has an unusual
   set of antennas, which led to the implementation of the specific antenna setup dialog.
