   Personal Notes of the Livery Editor (mhab):
   ------------------------------------------
   ZS-HOY is hardly found in the WEB. It is very similar to F-GOLH and very beautiful.
   Due to the similarity with F-GOLH it was limited effort to do it, but some differences
   exist.

   One special characteristic of this variant are the enlarged luggage boxes.
