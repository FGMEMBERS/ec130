   Personal Notes of the Livery Editor (mhab):
   ------------------------------------------
   A flight in this very EC130-B4 N155GC over Grand Canyon in Sept. 2011 was unforgettable.
   This experience together with a passion for RC model helicopters started the whole
   FlightGear activity for the EC130 model.

   It was the motivation to try and prepare a model as close as possible to the machine we
   had been flying. In a sense it ignited the whole effort to dig into FlightGear and
   keep on improving despite all the obstacles on the long way to learn how to do a
   real advanced model in a simulator.

   The model has a minimum of equipment but one of the most beautiful liveries.
