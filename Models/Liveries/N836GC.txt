   Personal Notes of the Livery Editor (mhab):
   ------------------------------------------
   The original heli model is a H130 (EC130 T2) which is a newer variant of the EC130-B4.
   N155GC of the same company was the first new livery done by me.

   The H130 was improved in many ways and differs from the EC130-B4 in right side doors, engine power,
   and several other details. For simplicity and until a special H130 variant is available in FG the
   differences are ignored for the sake of providing this special livery.
