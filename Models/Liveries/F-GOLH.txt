   Personal Notes of the Livery Editor (mhab):
   ------------------------------------------
   F-GOLH is an amazingly beautiful livery. When I first saw it I almost couldn't believe.
   It was pure joy to do it. There exists a popular scale helicopter model of this
   very livery too.

   As a special reward the first screenshot of this livery posted on Twitter was retweeted by
   Airbus Helicopter USA  @AirbusHC_usa.
