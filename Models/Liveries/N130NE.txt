   Personal Notes of the Livery Editor (mhab):
   ------------------------------------------
   The primary reason to choose this livery was, that it carried an SX16 Nightsun
   searchlight, which was not easy to find on pictures in the net.

   During the creation phase of the MedFlight livery the model of the SX16 searchlight
   got more and more refinded until it reached it's high level of detail.

   Further into the editing the need for a special medical setup variant arose, which has
   less seats and a stretch for a patient.

   Especially encouraging was the positive feedback of MedFlight personnel about
   various screenshots of this beautiful heli.
