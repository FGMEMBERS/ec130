   Personal Notes of the Livery Editor (mhab):
   ------------------------------------------
   The PR-BOP livery is extraordinary in every sense and was a real challenge to do.
   Of all the EC130 liveries this was - by far - the most difficult one.
   It may look like random, but every piece of color follows a defined scheme.

   Additionally the writing and special signs changed various times throughout recent
   years. The current livery is done according to some pics and videos, which
   show a design as of the time of this writing.

   This variant of the EC130 is equipped with a ton of different antennas,
   which raised the need to provide a special antenna setup dialog.
