   MAC Rescue Helicopter
   ---------------------

   MAC is short for: (M)otor (A)ccident (C)ommission

   MAC Rescue is South Australia's rescue helicopter service and conducts more than 1,000
   missions across the state each year.

   MAC Rescue comprises three helicopters and is used by the health and emergency service
   organisations to undertake medical retrieval, policing, bushfire management and search
   and rescue tasks.

   MAC Rescue covers all areas of South Australia.

   MAC took over the sponsorship of the State Rescue Helicopter Service in July 2009,
   further strengthening its commitment to reducing the number and impact of road injuries
   and deaths from motor vehicle crashes.

   Personal Notes of the Livery Editor (mhab):
   ------------------------------------------
   The MAC rescue livery is quite impressive and unusual. There were not too many pictures
   available on the net as of the time of this writing.

   The model specifics of VH-OSA are an unusual V/UHF antenna and a very modern searchlight on
   the pilot's side. As of the time of this writing it took a while to find out about what type
   of searchlight it is. It is the Trakkabeam A800, manufactured by Trakka corporation
   based in Melbourne/Australia. http://www.trakkacorp.com/products/a-800
   It is of very modern design, smaller than the SX-16 of Spectrolab and - without questioning -
   state-of-the-art.

   Difficulties in editing the otherwise relatively easy VH-OSA livery were the unusual font
   used for the characteristic "MAC rescue" logo and the red-white color border which crosses
   the landing gear in a difficult angle. The texturing of this part of the model is very hard
   to handle due to the complex mapping of various small surfaces. It required some very detailed
   editing.
